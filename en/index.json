I started it back when it came out and really enjoyed it but I got distracted fairly quickly. So when the industry was hyping up Eternal, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d jump back in. Shit, that game is great. Doom 2016\u0026rsquo;s arena combat is so addictive. I was sad when I finished it, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to leave that red-tinted world. And the glory kills\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s so satisfying to whittle down a Mancubus\u0026rsquo; health until you can pull its heart out and shove it down its mouth.\nThe gameplay is violent, graphic, uber-fast. But you\u0026rsquo;re constantly strategizing too \u0026ndash; switching between guns and searching out ammo or power-ups depending on the type and number of enemies you\u0026rsquo;re facing off against. And I continually found myself grinning, yelling with joy anytime I completed a particularly tricky arena fight or glory killed a revenant. Plus the environmental puzzles to find armor upgrades and cute little doom dolls was not something I expected from this game.\nBut I found myself wanting respite from the constant violence, which is where Animal Crossing: New Horizons comes in. As of today, I\u0026rsquo;ve logged over 80 hours into that fucking game. It\u0026rsquo;s so addictive. And my neighbors are so cute.\nI think my fav neighbor is Rex, this bug-loving weirdo lion who sits underneath the shade of a tree with this big dopey grin on their face. I love them. Don\u0026rsquo;t tell my other neighbors though. Honestly after writing this I think I might go farm some more tarantulas. Flick\u0026rsquo;s on my island today so I gotta get that price boost.\nLuckily, I\u0026rsquo;m past the end credits, and even though my to-do list is still hella long, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I get extremely sucked in as much. I can play for an hour or so and then put it down, having done all I wanted to for the day. Unless I\u0026rsquo;m farming ranchies, that takes a few hours tbh.\nSadly, I finished Doom 2016 last week. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll play Eternal until it goes on sale, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard mixed things about it cough the marauder cough so probs gonna hold off. Plus I just started into Sekiro and, damn. What a great game. I\u0026rsquo;ve also heard a lot about Horizon\u0026rsquo;s Gate (it\u0026rsquo;s like a combo of Stardew Valley/FF Tactics/old SNES rpgs but with pirates so uh) \u0026ndash; excited to give that one a try too.\n","description":"thoughts on two recent video games i've been playing","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["doom","acnh","video games"],"title":"Doom and Animal Crossing","uri":"https://wordvoid.net/en/posts/first_post/"}]
