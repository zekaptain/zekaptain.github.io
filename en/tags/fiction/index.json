[{"content":"A fetus lay at the bottom of the bloody basin. Its umbilical cord swallows the viscera strewn about it. Sacrificial bodies dismembered to provide the fetus nourishment for its birth. Disembodied heads, clumps of body hair caked in blood, burst testicles and severed limbs. Hands reach for the edges of the basin, an attempt at escape, even in death clinging to life. The gore-child devours all. Soon it will rise. Its boundless hunger once dormant, now ravenous. The zealots tremble and cry out for their savior. Their screams do not fall on deaf ears.\n","description":"CW: gore","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["fiction"],"title":"Birth of the Gore-child","uri":"https://wordvoid.net/en/posts/gore-child/"},{"content":"I had this conversation a while ago with a friend who expressed complete despair over Bernie Sanders\u0026rsquo; campaign suspension and what four more years of either Trump or Biden means for the Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate. Our planet\u0026rsquo;s climate is warming at an alarming rate, and we\u0026rsquo;re only seeing the effects of carbon dioxide emissions from thirty years ago. Even more, that rate is accelerating \u0026ndash; the emissions we\u0026rsquo;re pumping into the air now will take effect even sooner. Fires are raging across California, hurricanes are bombarding the East Coast and environmental racism puts the brunt of the climate disaster on minoritized groups.\nSo I get where my friend is coming from. If we delay rapid de-escalation of the fossil fuel industry and carbon dioxide emissions another year, the climate emergency will become even more catastrophic. Half a decade more of business as usual? The year 2100 will be an absolute fucking nightmare.\nBut, the president of the US is always going to be an enemy of the planet. The president is the leader of a government built on exploitation and destruction \u0026ndash; of people, of land, of cultures and families. Even if Bernie were elected, he\u0026rsquo;d be our enemy. Yes, he would work tirelessly to pass a Green New Deal. But he couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it alone, and he certainly couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it within a year of taking office. The McConnells and Pelosis of the world would see to that.\nHell, the entire United States was built on the backs of the enslaved to enrich the white ruling class at the expense of everything and everyone else. Our government is working exactly as it was meant to.\nBut more importantly, the issue with tackling existential, long-term crises is that it takes a hell of a lot of people and coordination and work to create lasting change. Presidents only stick around for four to eight years. The Senate and House can turn blue or red depending on how badly they fucked up that year. Governments won\u0026rsquo;t lift a finger and then take credit when people force change. There will always be more work.\nAnd lucky for us, we know what that work is. It\u0026rsquo;s fostering community, talking to your coworkers about joining or starting a union, building communities on radical compassion and respect for each other and the planet. Centering our Black and POC and Indigenous friends \u0026amp; colleagues \u0026amp; family. Showing up for our homeless neighbors. Learning how to protect our communities from fascism, racism, transphobia, homophobia. There are so many material ways we can work to make the world a better place.\nOur power lies with each other.\nSo yeah. Don\u0026rsquo;t be a doomer. Or, be a doomer in the trenches with us.\n#blacklivesmatter\n","description":"Neo had a third option - giving up","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["blackpill","nihilism","mental health","doomers"],"title":"Blackpilled","uri":"https://wordvoid.net/en/posts/second_post/"},{"content":"Wolf has never made it this far. He can see the next idol just up ahead. All he has to do is get past this courtyard of enemies \u0026ndash; on extremely low health. One final hit and he\u0026rsquo;s out. Ahead, there are two swordsmen, an archer, and three dogs. He leaps up onto a tree branch. He launches shurikens at the three dogs \u0026ndash; easy. Wait for one of the swordsmen to pass underneath. Jump, slash. Only three more enemies. Wolf peers around the corner. He sees a way to sneak behind the archer. Crouching, he makes his way through tall grass and past burnt down buildings. He takes out the archer from behind. Only one swordsman left. Wolf sprints forward, launches an attack. The man stumbles, regains composure, attacks. Wolf dodges the first attack, circles around. Strikes. The enemy blocks and launches into an attack. Dodge, dodge \u0026ndash; shit. Wolf timed the second dodge incorrectly, and the swordsman\u0026rsquo;s blade bites flesh. Wolf already used his resurrection \u0026ndash; DEATH flashes across the screen.\nI take off my headphones, push back from my monitor, and take my dog out for a walk. I gotta blow off some steam. This fucking game.\nI like to think that I\u0026rsquo;m at least decent when it comes to video games. I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing games since I was a kid \u0026ndash; losing constantly to those damn Plungelos on the mirrors on Gelato Beach, staying up all night at Halo 2 LAN parties, and playing the shit out of that Battlefront 2 demo that came with the Star Wars Episode III DVD. And as I grew and played more games, I found myself drawn to a certain type: open-world RPGs.\nI think I was attracted to these types of games because they generally let me play in a particular way. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know why \u0026ndash; maybe it\u0026rsquo;s my anxiety? \u0026ndash; but I always play as cautiously as possible. I crouch, I sneak, I kill from afar. If enemies get close, I sprint away. And if I can\u0026rsquo;t avoid an encounter, I typically move in a circular pattern, round and round the enemy, just out of range from them, firing off whatever ranged weapon I have. If a game lets me use a bow, I will. I\u0026rsquo;ll sneak and be deathly silent and loose my arrows. Sometimes, if I get caught, I\u0026rsquo;ll just load up the save right before the encounter.\nAnd open-world RPGs really indulge me in this method of play. So much so that recently I\u0026rsquo;ve felt an itch to branch out, try new games that I never would have tried before. Part of this desire comes from listening to games critics talking about their favorite games. Anytime I listen to Waypoint or Bad End or Abnormal Mapping, I want to download and play whatever they\u0026rsquo;re gushing about at the time. But god, are video games hard.\nEven Sekiro - a game that requires stealth and tactical precision - throws me off. And I think I know why. It\u0026rsquo;s the dying. Losing progress, going back not just to a recent autosave, but to a checkpoint many enemies previously. Fighting enemies that have already killed you ten times over, hoping you don\u0026rsquo;t make a small mistake that will cost you your life (again).\nThis same mechanic is brought to the fore in rogue-likes and roguelites. If you die, you don\u0026rsquo;t just revert to a checkpoint. You start the game over. Into the Breach, Dead Cells \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I\u0026rsquo;m drawn to the games that hurt me, but here I am. Hopefully I actually get better at them soon.\nSpeaking of tough games, I\u0026rsquo;m currently hooked on Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. I love the look and feel of it, and how missions feel like solving a complex puzzle. It gives off a good brainfeel. I also started Sunless Skies. Wow, I love the tone of it. It\u0026rsquo;s so meditative and tense in turn, and the writing is good. I feel such a weird combination of terror and peace while chugging through the sky.\nNext up, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to try out Star Renegades. The look of that game is stunning.\n","description":"do i have to play through this *again?*","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["sekiro","into the breach","dead cells","shadow tactics blades of the shogun","sunless skies","star renegades"],"title":"God, I Hate Dying","uri":"https://wordvoid.net/en/posts/third_post/"},{"content":"Hey, my name\u0026rsquo;s zoe.

I started it back when it came out and really enjoyed it but I got distracted fairly quickly. So when the industry was hyping up Eternal, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d jump back in. Shit, that game is great. Doom 2016\u0026rsquo;s arena combat is so addictive. I was sad when I finished it, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to leave that red-tinted world. And the glory kills\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s so satisfying to whittle down a Mancubus\u0026rsquo; health until you can pull its heart out and shove it down its mouth.\nThe gameplay is violent, graphic, uber-fast. But you\u0026rsquo;re constantly strategizing too \u0026ndash; switching between guns and searching out ammo or power-ups depending on the type and number of enemies you\u0026rsquo;re facing off against. And I continually found myself grinning, yelling with joy anytime I completed a particularly tricky arena fight or glory killed a revenant. Plus the environmental puzzles to find armor upgrades and cute little doom dolls was not something I expected from this game.\nBut I found myself wanting respite from the constant violence, which is where Animal Crossing: New Horizons comes in. As of today, I\u0026rsquo;ve logged over 80 hours into that fucking game. It\u0026rsquo;s so addictive. And my neighbors are so cute.\nI think my fav neighbor is Rex, this bug-loving weirdo lion who sits underneath the shade of a tree with this big dopey grin on their face. I love them. Don\u0026rsquo;t tell my other neighbors though. Honestly after writing this I think I might go farm some more tarantulas. Flick\u0026rsquo;s on my island today so I gotta get that price boost.\nLuckily, I\u0026rsquo;m past the end credits, and even though my to-do list is still hella long, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I get extremely sucked in as much. I can play for an hour or so and then put it down, having done all I wanted to for the day. Unless I\u0026rsquo;m farming ranchies, that takes a few hours tbh.\nSadly, I finished Doom 2016 last week. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll play Eternal until it goes on sale, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard mixed things about it cough the marauder cough so probs gonna hold off. Plus I just started into Sekiro and, damn. What a great game. I\u0026rsquo;ve also heard a lot about Horizon\u0026rsquo;s Gate (it\u0026rsquo;s like a combo of Stardew Valley/FF Tactics/old SNES rpgs but with pirates so uh) \u0026ndash; excited to give that one a try too.\n","description":"thoughts on two recent video games i've been playing","id":5,"section":"posts","tags":["doom","acnh","video games"],"title":"Doom and Animal Crossing","uri":"https://wordvoid.net/en/posts/first_post/"}]
