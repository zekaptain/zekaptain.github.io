      <description>So Doom Eternal came out recently, which made me want to go back and actually finish Doom 2016. I started it back when it came out and really enjoyed it but I got distracted fairly quickly. So when the industry was hyping up Eternal, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d jump back in. Shit, that game is great. Doom 2016&amp;rsquo;s arena combat is so addictive. I was sad when I finished it, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave that red-tinted world.</description>
